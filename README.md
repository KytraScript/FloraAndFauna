# Kytra Presents: Flora And Fauna
---

### Description: Work-in-Progress
Flora and Fauna is Modern React driven browser based game.  Using the Context API and the useReducer pattern, Flora and Fauna
allows players to purchase various animals and biomes (plots) to maximize player profits and fuel plot expansions.  Most of
the visuals are currently in place with the game logic being Kytra's current focus.  The final game roster will allow the
player to choose from 14 different villagers each with their own animal type affinity as well as 32 individual animals to
place in the various biomes.
